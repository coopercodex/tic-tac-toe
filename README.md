  ## Introduction
    Hello my name is Derek Cooper and i implemented javascript, Html and Css to complete this project. This game of tic-tac-toe utilizes my understanding of class to class interaction to make a functional game!

    This was my final project for Mod 1 in Turing School of Software and Design.
