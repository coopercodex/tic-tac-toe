  ## Introduction
  
  Hello my name is Derek Cooper and i implemented javascript, Html and Css to complete this project. This game of tic-tac-toe utilizes my understanding of class to class interaction to make a fully functional game!

    This was my final project for Mod 1 in Turing School of Software and Design.

  ## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS


  ## Features

  My version of this game has you fully immeresed in the matrix for a head to head battle of uh...choices.  You start off by choosing a spot for one side, then as you wish you place the opposing sides game piece in one of the alluring boxes.  Once a you get 3 in a row you are prompted that a win has been acquired!  Congrats!  This game also deals with draws in a very anticlimactic form.  Hope you enjoy this game as the functionality was perfected over many hours.

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  The possible extensions that i have in mind include making a transforming backround when a player wins, a few links to movie scenes and some sample sounds that make the page more interactive.
